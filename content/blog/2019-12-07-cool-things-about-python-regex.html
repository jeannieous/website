<h1>Regex</h1>
<p>Regular expression, also called regex, is a sequence of charaters that matches other sequences with certain patterns. It is kind of like a fancy version of ctrl+f using python!</p>
<p>Letâ€™s look at some examples of regex!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(reticulate)
#use_python(&quot;/usr/local/bin/python3&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>import re

string1=&quot;We have to extract these numbers 12, 47, 48 The integers numbers are also interesting: 189 2036 314\&#39;,\&#39; is a separator, so please extract these numbers 125,789,1450 and also these 564,90456 We like to offer you 7890$ per month in order to complete this task... we are joking&quot;

re.findall(r&quot;\d+&quot;, string1)

#In order to pull all numbers from string 1, &quot;\d+&quot; was used. \d codes for any digits from 0 to 9. Therefore, the first digit from any number is pulled by this. Then, + is added to match any digits 1 or more times.</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [&#39;12&#39;, &#39;47&#39;, &#39;48&#39;, &#39;189&#39;, &#39;2036&#39;, &#39;314&#39;, &#39;125&#39;, &#39;789&#39;, &#39;1450&#39;, &#39;564&#39;, &#39;90456&#39;, &#39;7890&#39;]</code></pre>
In order to pull all numbers from string 1, <code>\d+</code> was used.
