      <description>RegexRegular expression, also called regex, is a sequence of charaters that matches other sequences with certain patterns. It is kind of like a fancy version of ctrl+f using python!
Letâ€™s look at some examples of regex!
library(reticulate)import restring1=&amp;quot;We have to extract these numbers 12, 47, 48 The integers numbers are also interesting: 189 2036 314\&amp;#39;,\&amp;#39; is a separator, so please extract these numbers 125,789,1450 and also these 564,90456 We like to offer you 7890$ per month in order to complete this task.</description>

      <description>0) IntroductionThe dataset that I have chosen for this project is the Fitness Trends dataset (25.csv), which was found on kaggle.com. It contains 7 variables (date, step_count, mood, calories_burned, hours_of_sleep, bool_of_active, weight_kg) and 96 observations. The dataset gives information about feeling active based on number of steps walked, mood, calories burned, hourse of sleep, and weight. I thought this dataset was interesting to look at since excersing is often used as a treatment for people who feel lethargic.</description>

      <description>0) IntroductionThe two datasets that I have chosen for this project is the Global Suicide Data (MH_12) and World Happiness Report (X2015), which were both found on kaggle.com. The Global Suicide Data contains 6 variables (Country, Sex, 2015, 2010, 2005, 2000) and 549 observations. It gives you the age-adjusted suicide rate (per 100,000) in different countries based on year and sex. The World Happiness Report contains 12 variables (Country, Region, Happiness rank, Happiness score, Standard Error, Economy, Family, Health, Freedom, Trust, Generosity, Dystopia residual) and 158 observations.</description>
